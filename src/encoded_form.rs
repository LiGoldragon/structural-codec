//! [`EncodedForm`] and [`EncodedConversion`] — the TRUTH-side half of the Protos
//! library pairing, seated beside the [`Textual`](crate::textual_form::Textual) view side.
//!
//! ## The pairing (ruled)
//!
//! A language family member has two faces of one truth:
//!
//! - its **EncodedForm** — a stringless, Core-associated value family (its names live
//!   in the nametree [`NameTable`], its shapes in the structuretree
//!   [`AddressedStructuralTable`](crate::table::AddressedStructuralTable)); and
//! - its **TextualForm** — one textual VIEW on that EncodedForm, produced and consumed
//!   through a [`Textual`](crate::textual_form::Textual).
//!
//! [`EncodedForm`] marks the truth side. A concrete Core value type (`CoreSchema`, the
//! lowered logos item set) IS an EncodedForm for its language `T`; the marker ties the
//! value family to the language identity the paired [`TextualForm`](crate::TextualForm)
//! and [`Textual`](crate::textual_form::Textual) share.
//!
//! ## The layer conversion — `EncodedForm<T> -> EncodedForm<X>` (ruled)
//!
//! [`EncodedConversion`] is the reusable piece the library creates for the psyche's
//! *real type conversion*: a language layer is converted to the next by moving its
//! EncodedForm to another EncodedForm, threading the continuous nametree — and NO text
//! appears anywhere on the path. The schema→logos lowering through the Nomos macros is
//! the first instance: `CoreSchema` (EncodedForm of schema) plus its `NameTable` go in,
//! the lowered logos items (EncodedForm of logos) plus the extended `NameTable` come
//! out, entirely as typed data.
//!
//! ### On the generic spelling
//!
//! The psyche named the shape `EncodedForm<T> -> EncodedForm<X> or similar`. Rust's
//! trait system expresses "generic over the language `T`" through an associated
//! [`Language`](EncodedForm::Language) marker rather than a type parameter on the trait
//! itself, so a value type implements `EncodedForm` once and NAMES its language; the
//! conversion's [`Source`](EncodedConversion::Source) and
//! [`Target`](EncodedConversion::Target) are those two encoded forms. This is the
//! closest faithful expression; where it differs from the literal `EncodedForm<T>` it
//! differs only in where the `T` is written (an associated type, not a parameter).
